This is how easy it is to start a new blog built with Gatsby and host it on Netlify.

Is  this really that simple?
now all I need to do is learn documentation?

seriously?

HMM..

So basically I can write a post here and have a good build of site in all this? this is nice!

why I am so scared of this whole issues then?
